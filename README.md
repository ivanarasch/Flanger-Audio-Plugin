# Flanger-Audio-Plugin
 a flanger plugin that uses an LFO to change delay time sinusoidally (sin) or linearly (saw) over a range of 0 - 25ms. Your plugin should have 5 GUI controls:

    LFO type (sin/saw)
    LFO frequency (0.1 - 3.0Hz)
    LFO depth (0.0 - 100.0%)
    LFO contrary motion (true/false)
    Feedback (0.0 - 99.0%)

The feedback parameter should be adjustable, but to get that classic metallic flanging sound the feedback should be kept quite high.
